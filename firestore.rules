/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for EncomiendaYA.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict ownership model for users and their related data (orders, reviews),
 * with admin privileges granted based on presence in the `/admins` collection.
 * It leverages denormalization of IDs within documents to simplify and secure authorization logic,
 * minimizing the need for costly `get()` operations.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /admins/{adminId}: Stores admin user accounts. Existence grants admin privileges.
 * - /stores/{storeId}: Stores store accounts.
 * - /stores/{storeId}/items/{itemId}: Stores items belonging to a store, with denormalized storeId.
 * - /delivery_personnel/{personnelId}: Stores delivery personnel accounts.
 * - /customers/{customerId}: Stores customer accounts.
 * - /customers/{customerId}/orders/{orderId}: Stores orders placed by customers.
 * - /customers/{customerId}/orders/{orderId}/reviews/{reviewId}: Stores reviews with denormalized customerId, orderId, and deliveryPersonnelId.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Admin privileges are determined solely by the presence of a document in the `/admins` collection.
 * - Users can only access their own customer documents and related data (orders, reviews).
 * - Stores and delivery personnel documents are accessible to anyone.
 * - Listing of users and admin accounts is forbidden.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - Items have a `storeId` field, allowing item-level rules to verify the parent store without extra reads.
 * - Reviews contain `customerId`, `orderId`, and `deliveryPersonnelId`, which avoids needing to look up parent documents for authorization.
