/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for EncomiendaYA.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a combination of ownership-based access control and
 * role-based access for admin users. Most data is scoped to specific users or
 * stores, and only authenticated users can access the database. Admin users,
 * identified by the presence of a document in the `/roles_admin/{uid}` collection,
 * are granted elevated privileges.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /stores/{storeId}: Stores account information, managed by the store itself or an admin.
 * - /stores/{storeId}/items/{itemId}: Items available at each store, managed by the store.
 * - /delivery_personnel/{deliveryPersonnelId}: Delivery personnel accounts, potentially managed by admins.
 * - /roles_admin/{uid}: Admin role assignments. Presence of a document grants admin privileges.
 * - /customers/{customerId}: Customer accounts, managed by the customer themselves.
 * - /customers/{customerId}/orders/{orderId}: Orders placed by customers.
 * - /customers/{customerId}/orders/{orderId}/order_items/{orderItemId}: Items within an order.
 * - /delivery_personnel/{deliveryPersonnelId}/reviews/{reviewId}: Customer reviews for delivery personnel.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Admins have full read and write access to all collections.
 * - Stores can manage their own store information and items.
 * - Customers can only manage their own customer information and orders.
 * - Delivery personnel information and reviews might be managed by admins.
 * - Listing all users is not allowed, enhancing user privacy.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - The 'Item' entity includes 'storeId' to allow item management rules to be enforced based on the store without needing to `get()` the store document.
 * - Orders include 'customerId', 'storeId', and 'deliveryPersonnelId' to enable security rules based on the authenticated user's ID without requiring hierarchical lookups.
 * - Reviews include 'customerId' and 'deliveryPersonnelId' to enable security rules based on the authenticated user's ID without requiring hierarchical lookups.
 *
 * Structural Segregation:
 * - Admins are managed in a separate `/roles_admin/{uid}` collection, simplifying role-based access control.
